The probability mass function for the `yulesimon` is:
    .. math::
        f(k) =  \alpha B(k, \alpha+1)
    for :math:`k=1,2,3,...`, where :math:`\alpha>0`.
    Here :math:`B` refers to the `scipy.special.beta` function.
    The sampling of random variates is based on pg 553, Section 6.3 of [1]_.
    Our notation maps to the referenced logic via :math:`\alpha=a-1`.
